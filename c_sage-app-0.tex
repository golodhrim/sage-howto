\chapter[cha:why]{Why an own Sage Server}

Most of you would now ask themself why they should set up their own Sage Server. The ones who used \from[sagenb] know that the server is sometimes really slow, and if you are working whole group on the server you would feel it even more.

So you wouldn't feel these slowdowns if you provide your students an own Sage Server. The next reason is that the \from[sagenb] only has a way to make worksheets publicly available and some students might not want it, so you have the opportunity to make the server only available from the intranet by firewalling it. And if you provide them a home access there are several other ways of doing it, keep for that a talk with your IT-Department.
